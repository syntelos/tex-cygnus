{\section Existential love}

\bigskip

There are many objects and aspects intended of {\it heart}.  The
spiritual heart of the inner consciousness relates to {\it existential
love} by sex.  

The existential consciousness is unencumbered by depravities of
habituation or violence.  The love of the sexual bond in the
existential consciousness is {\it existential love}.

It is a choice.  That this definition of existential love should be
sexual.  It is a challenge.  To overcome {\it sex-love} and {\it
sex-sex} by {\it heart-love} to the exclusion of sex.

As much as that, to achieve the {\it heart-love} of existential love,
requires enough work that sex becomes circumstantial.  Relevant but
tangential.  And thereby virtually nonexistent.

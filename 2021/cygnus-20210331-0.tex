{\section Conservation of self}

\bigskip

Julie is my wife.  Not by any fact.  By an imaginary interpretation of
a cup of tea.  Yesterday she made me an herbal tea, ``Good for your
lymphatic system'', and dosed it with many magical ingredients of
imagination.

Ultimately it is an ego vacation.  A vacated ego has an expansive
metaphysical range, including the experience of physical and
metaphysical actuality.

Perhaps by writing this, a step is taken that will make it true.  And
equally likely is the inverse.

This enlightenment is familiar to Buddhism.

\medskip

{\line {\hfill The buddha is a person.}}
{\line {\hfill You are the buddha.}}
{\line {\hfill Your buddha-person is you}}
{\line {\hfill with eyes wide open.}}

\medskip

Without ego, the trauma of violence and habituation of language, you
see me.  I see you.

We readily habituate to the labors and pleasures only to miss the
sights and sounds of this existence.

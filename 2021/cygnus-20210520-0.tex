{\title One particularly insane person}

{\date Thursday, 20 May 2021}

{\section The nightmare in his blood}

\bigskip

The observable is insanity.  The distinction from inanity, in this
case, would be the evident crisis.  The neurotic episodes, and their
random manifestation with psychotic episodes.

That I listen is a problem.  That I see is a problem.  That I hear is
a problem.  That I am present is a problem.  That's in the physical
sensory experiential reference frame.  Over the horizon in an imagined
socio-political frame of reference I could see parallel processes of
mockery and discovery.  Julie is absent.  The weight of that is
speaking.

{\section In awareness}

\bigskip

It is a process of self actualization when we review memory and
emotion, when we dream.  In these processes of self actualization we
review the experience of actuality.

\medskip
The adoptions and adaptations of the neurology have many perspectives,
and many processes.  In abstraction beyond physicality we find
significant elements of common substance.  In metaphysics we identify
actualization.  And realization.

\medskip
It is a process of self realization when we find understanding,
explore discovery, seek comprehension, and formulate expression.  The
elements of reality are these products.

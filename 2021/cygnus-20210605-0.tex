{\section Participation}

\bigskip

It is in awareness that we discover the agility and skill to participate.

\medskip
The dissuations from the horizons and presents of participation
disintegrate in the experience of awareness.

\medskip
The discouragements from the capacities and fortitudes of
participation disintegrate in the experience of awareness.

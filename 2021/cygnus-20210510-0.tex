{\section Maggie Munchkins}

\bigskip

Dear Maggie,

I've taken it upon myself to analyze Munchkin, and have arrived at a
noovelty.  Girls are different than boys.

And because of this, they develop with greater self awareness.  Girls
are naturally endowed with physical self awareness.  And it's up to
their parents, and their parents' brothers and sisters, to get that
perspective some handles.  Their eyes are full of other things, that
their minds are occupied with sorting.

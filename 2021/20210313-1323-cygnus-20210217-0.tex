Bugsy,

I don't think you're going to get this from your parthenon on your
acropolis, but I'm really just talking about Brook and Maggie, and
Cricket and Gina, and Erin and Shelby, and Rey and Kimberly.  And
Tina.

The time is like the heart.  The slow motion serves patience and
learning, but demands a new larger heart muscle.  The social ping pong
is breathtaking, but seems like a glacial advance or a submarine
party.

Peter

{\section Junkie}

\bigskip

Let's define the term {\bf Junkie} to represent the individual for
whom society is unknown.  The class of undergraduates as those who
failed to graduate from kindergarten, to accept other as same.  To
find awareness.  The class who rejects or subverts substance and
significance, syntax and semantics, and the methods and means of our
sustenance to the destruction of self, other, and society.

The practicing nihilist is a junkie.  Every inanity has force of
destruction in the mystery of annihilation.  

\medskip

The experience of inanity is the sights and sounds of insanity.  

\medskip

The junkie has rights.  However the assertions of the junkie must be
ignored.  And the accomodation of the junkie must be rejected.
Because it is not possible to witness inanity as substance of meaning.
It is not possible to ascribe understanding to that communication, to
derive meaning from those expressions.  It is the imposition of an
avaricious greed.  It is a tragedy.  It is from whence humor is
absurd, meaning is transient, and substance is absent.

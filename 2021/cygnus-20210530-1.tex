{\section Extortion}

\bigskip

That Alex Bergdahl pursues a criminal extortion is familiar to the
pattern of development when we find consistency of intent.  The
pursuit of control is common to addiction and desperation.  The
conclusion to intent to project power over others is evident in
gaming.  A consistency to induction is plainly available.  The
suggestions of sex are unmistakable.

As a pursuit of control becomes apparent and unavoidable, criminality
replaces insanity as the preferred hypothesis of behavioral
explication.

The comedy of errors suggests that I am isolated and vulnerable to his
criminally insane advances.  That argument and debate will confuse and
confound any available observation.  And that the construction of such
``scrambled eggs'' is intentional and criminal.

Unfortunately for Alex Bergdahl, that ``raisin bread'' has been baked
on the stone.

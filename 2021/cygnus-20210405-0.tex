{\section Existential love}

\bigskip

I had a dream last night that Kiesza was a flying tiger.  That her
intent was personal and romantic and flying through space and time
like a very big cat.  Like a tiger.  Her world order was a cosmology.
And it meant that she could fly.

When she came to me we met by landing on a stage.  Her face was like
Tove.  And then we flew apart before her show.  Each time a bit more
messy.  With swinging light bars, draping ropes, increasingly
threatening or challenging my performance of her cosmology.

Not that that makes any sense.  When I reflect on the scene wakefully
I wonder why I would be on that stage.  It does make wonderful sense
as an amalgam, however, of so many stories and their entanglements.

Last night I saw Maggie.  The sight of her was too brief.  But she
arrived in my world like another flying tiger.

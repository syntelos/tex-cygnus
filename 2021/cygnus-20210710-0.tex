{\section Trust}

\bigskip

I have found a moment's reflection in your message.  A thread through
the air that hangs in still life like a creation of Arachne.  To
balance possession and humanity.  The terms of trust and reproduction.
Spelt in ribbons of affection.

The power of Arachne transcends the niggling of experience.  Doubt.
And the discovery of intent.

A piece of Lapis rom Afghanistan is here.  In heaven.  A divine token
of trust.

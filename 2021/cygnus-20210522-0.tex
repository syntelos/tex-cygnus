{\section It's a small world}

\bigskip

She left as quickly as she arrived.  Carrying a basket of plants that
seemed to read like a library.  The effect was chilling.

Perhaps it was intended to be welcoming.  If you believe in that kind
of thing.  Society.  Social ley lines.  ``The veils are thinner in the
mountains.''.  Was that her?  Maybe.

{\section Premier}

\bigskip

The first occurred on Monday, the seventeenth of this month.  Two
weeks ago.  Some ridiculously peculiar issue was turned to the
authoritarian challenge of the decade.

My challenge to his authority was unwelcome, and incongruous.  That's
the theme.

We should be allies.  We must seek diplomacy.  That's a hook.  Along
with every other thing, including the sexual suggestions which might as
well be the accidental course of habit.

The Doctor Jekyl and Mister Hyde is a bit grave.

{\section Extortion}

\bigskip

The episodes of abuse turned to explicit threats including the
explicit acknowledgement of the threat to displace me.  Against a
grand, mysterious, spatial acquiescence.

The phone in his hand showed ``Darcel''.  The threats turned the color
of implicit ``people'' to displace me, with quite a study before being
turned to ``police''.

\medskip
``I can't made heads or tails of a word you say.''.

\smallskip
``That's extortion.''.

\smallskip
``That's abuse.''.

\medskip

These episodes are most colorful.  Mine are simple.  Staying within
the ping pong style of the diatribe.

\medskip

``I feel like I made the mistake of listening to you.''.

\smallskip

``Wow!  Have you ever raped anyone?''.

\medskip

Somehow, inexplicably, in the end he returned to measure solace and
gratitude with professional courtesy.  I have the impression that the
pattern is expected.  That I should record my part, because his part
is fairly routine.

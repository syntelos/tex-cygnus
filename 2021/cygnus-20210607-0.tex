{\section Metaphysical power}

\bigskip

The power of self is individual metaphysical power.  A capacity for
focus.  A durability of purpose.  A consistency of intent.  A
constancy of application.

\medskip
The general concept is the ancient product of education.  The modern
metaphysical epistemological detail is illumination.  Each geographic
region and cultural locale has a humanist tradition, which is
typically focused on the conservation of life inclusive of
environment, and liberty inclusive of independence and
interdependence.

\medskip
Perhaps the most ancient is to be found in Theology.  Perhaps the most
modern is to be found in Philosophy.  Certainly the most practical is
to be found in Government.

practical convenience to aggression, abuse, injury, and destruction.
The novelty that distinguishes the junkie from other classes of
criminal is the fantasy, delusion, and self destruction.  A normal
criminal has a higher priority for self preservation and interest.

In the Bergdahl case, the displays of hyper -- objectification become
plain with experience to handle the violence.  Therefore this fals
into my theory of developmental psychology under the rubric of a
nihsistential crisis.  In this case the term represents

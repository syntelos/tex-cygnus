{\section I want to see}
\medskip

Love in trust, solidarity, reinforcement.
\smallskip
Sociality in health and wellbeing.
\smallskip
Intellectuality in spirit of society.
\smallskip
With two eyes that recognize love and fear at sight.
\smallskip
With balance to reject use and take.
\smallskip
And with stillness to reflect on what I encounter.

{\section I can see her heart}
\medskip

The radiance of love.
\smallskip
The veil of inanity.
\smallskip
Her society.  Her mind.  Her body.
\smallskip
The terms of being reduced to immediacy and convenience because the
algebra of breath and blood is demanding.

{\title Experiential existentialism}

{\date Saturday, 10 April 2021}

\bigskip

Language and culture have long adopted the inanity of insanity.  The
conceit is a device of delusion.
\smallskip
Our freedom from the veils of inanity is our perpetual acquisition of
the discipline of fortitude.
\smallskip
Our recognition of the effort required of our fortitude.
\smallskip
Our recognition of the effect of our sociiety.
\smallskip
Awareness.

{\section I thought I saw you standing there}

\bigskip

I'm so in love with you,
\smallskip
burns the soul.
\medskip
The power of love,
\smallskip
a force from above,
\smallskip
a sky scraping dove.
\medskip
I know what we have to do.
\smallskip
We have to surrender.
\smallskip
We have to meet.
\smallskip
And then to never lose the other.

\bye

{\section Conservation of self}

\bigskip

It is necessary to conclude the affair.  I cannot make as much matter
of that thread of recognition as thin as silk.  The confluence is not
sensible, within.

Her assertions are not known.  Her expressions bear threads of sense
and significance in humanity.  However, her obscurity betrays
partnership or at least communication in fidelity to my self.  It may
be her intent to be recognized as self and same, but I am unable to
claim the assertion.

It could be her intent to speak to the world of our self destruction.
Our reckless disregard for our sustenance.  Like Paltrow.  And
millions and billions of others.

I can't imagine that, either.  Would that not be spoken?  Is it not
the intimacy of self that is found at the frontiers of body and
emotion?  The worlds upon worlds within?

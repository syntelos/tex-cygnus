{\section Junkie}

\bigskip

It occurs to me that the mechanical model of the fantasy in play is
fairly conventional depravity.  Extortion to subjugation by violence.  

The message is harassment, with plenty of assertion of imaginary
emphasis.  So, therefore, violence.  

The object appears as general subjugation.  The many references to
authority, and numerous demonstrations of ego and vanity are
resplendent.  

Familiar patterns: ``the whore who would be king'' (Donald Trump);
``junkie shooting air into his arm'' (Raisin Bread).  Both are
examples of parasitic degrees of delusion and dependence.

{\title Ena Vida Athena Apollo}

{\date Thursday, 3 June 2021}

{\section In gratitude}

\bigskip

Clouds hang overhead in low pressure.  I've been reading a bit of
Greek theological history.  We always refer to the classical Greek
literary icons as mythological, but in doing so we lose the sense of
that history.  An error of self preservation that underestimates us.

\medskip
A work of fiction, however, might create a mythological god as icon of
representation.  {\it Ena Vida Athena Apollo} has a mediterranean name
with intensely powerful classical elements.  This icon is gender
neutral.  The object of the thought experiment is conceptual.

\medskip
The icon presents a person as a social entity produced by self
realization.  The effort of self realization yields many products of
humor and intellect, reflection and expression.  Direct and indirect.

{\section Conservation of sovereignty}

\bigskip

It's been eighty-four hours since I last saw Roan.  I feel certain
that I would be remiss in not including her in my metaphysical
process.

She rests within as the most ethereal partner-other, held secure and
largely unknown.  The spaces of her possibilities have been truncated
by the necessity of my continuation.  By convenience to my own self
realization.  I trust that her assertions are sensible within my
metaphysical process.

That intersection has been crossed involuntarily.  Love is ``in'' or
``out''.  Inclusive or exclusive.  And she did seem to assert the
former.  According to my selfish interpretations of her expression.

The probable error seems rather incompatibility.

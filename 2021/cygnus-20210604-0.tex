{\section Horizons}

\bigskip

If we allow our avatar to lift us into abstraction, we might imagine
balancing on air above the trees to see the horizon in every
direction.

\medskip
We should not be surprised to see absurdity or inanity because they
are common.  And we should not be surprised by an occasional rarity of
sense or reason because understanding is always in proportion to
effort.

\medskip
One is often dependent on the future of awareness.  On the will to
endure the exercise that reveals the experience that leads to the
awareness that affords understanding.  Time is always in favor of
awareness.
